UI Should be Rich and will be considered for grading
A Readme file should be included explaining the features implemented and how and where in your pages they were implemented.




List of all the SCSS/SASS features implemented -

Variables => Created all the Variables in a separate SCSS file. 

Custom Properties => Aslo known as CSS Variables. Used in style.scss file in footer selector.

Nesting => Used to nest CSS selectors. In index.scss file used nesting in nav, card and footer selectors. In contactMe.scss file used nesting in nav, card, social, location and footer selectors. In aboutMe.scss file used nesting in nav, carousel and footer.

Interpolation => Used in a Sass stylesheet to embed the result of a SassScript expression into a chunk of CSS. 
Placeholder Selectors => It is a class selector, but it starts with a % and it's not included in the CSS output. Used in button in style.scss. Defined a %button Placeholder selector and used @extend to use it inside body selector.

Mixins => @mixin lets us create reusable css code. Created two separate index and contact scss files. They contain mixins which contain multiple css Properties. Used @import to import scss files in style.scss ,  Used @include inside index.scss for button and position.

Functions => It allow to define complex operations on SassScript values that we can re-use throughout your stylesheet. used linear-gradient
